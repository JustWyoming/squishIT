###Description:
One of our first assignments at General Assembly was to create a tiny URL app. I wanted to have a name that really would have the potential to be viral and interesting in the world of Tiny URL apps.

###Challenges:
Javascript was a such a steep learning curve for this visual designer turned developer! After the intimidation wore off, excitement took over and the overall scale of the project was totally within my scope. It was gratifying to build something I could share via heroku with family.

###Wishlist:
This was my first time using Bootstrap and Javascript, and in all honesty, there's not a lot I would change about it. I might re-do the size of the logo, as I mocked it up post midnight the night before presentation and didn't make it vector. I'd also probably look into getting Squish.it as a domain. I'm sure the Italians wouldn't mind.

###Tools:
Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, Heroku
